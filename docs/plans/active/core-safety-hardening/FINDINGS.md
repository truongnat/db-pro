# Findings

## P1 — Explain safety bypass

`QueryService::execute` validates the connection policy, but `QueryService::explain`
only rejects multi-statements before calling the connector. PostgreSQL wraps the SQL
in `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)`, and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` executes the inner statement.

Impact: a read-only connection can execute a write through the Explain path.

Decision: reuse the existing safety classifier before invoking the connector.

## P1 — Zero-row mutation reported as success

The table service returns the connector's raw affected-row count and the runtime maps
any `Ok(_)` result to generic success. A missing/stale primary-key target therefore
looks successful.

Impact: callers can discard staged state after no database row was changed.

Decision: table mutations return `DbError::NotFound` when zero rows are affected. This
keeps callers from treating any zero-row mutation as a successful state change.

## P1 — SQLite timeout not enforced

SQLite execution runs on a dedicated actor thread and the async handle only waits on
a oneshot. Dropping the wait does not stop SQLite's VM.

Impact: a timed-out/cancelled request can keep the actor occupied indefinitely.

Decision: retain the actor model but expose rusqlite's `InterruptHandle`; a timeout
interrupts the VM and returns `DbError::QueryTimeout`.

## P1 — SSH host verification disabled

Both SSH command paths pass `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`.

Impact: SSH tunnels are vulnerable to host impersonation.

Decision: remove the bypass and let OpenSSH enforce its configured known-host policy.
