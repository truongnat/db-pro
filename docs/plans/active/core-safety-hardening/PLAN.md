# Core Safety Hardening

## Goal

Close the highest-risk correctness and security gaps in the core database path
without changing the native UI or adding product features.

## Scope

- `crates/core`: application safety and mutation invariants.
- `crates/infrastructure`: PostgreSQL/SQLite execution behavior and SSH command safety.
- `crates/runtime`: only if required to preserve the core contract at the runtime boundary.

## Non-goals

- No changes to `crates/ui`, `crates/native-app`, Tauri, Agent/MCP, or visual design.
- No schema migration, import workflow, or new provider feature.
- No claim of live PostgreSQL or native UI verification in this wave.

## Findings driving this wave

1. `QueryService::explain` bypasses the persisted safety policy, so `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
   can execute a mutation on a read-only connection.
2. Table mutations pass through `affected_rows = 0` as success, hiding stale or missing
   row identities.
3. SQLite ignores the configured query timeout because its actor has no interrupt path.
4. SSH commands disable host-key verification.
5. PostgreSQL backup/restore factories discard `ssh_tunnel`, so external backup
   commands bypass the connection's configured tunnel.

## Acceptance criteria

- Explain validates against the same safety policy as query execution.
- Update/delete with zero affected rows return a typed `NotFound`/conflict error.
- SQLite query execution interrupts the SQLite VM when the configured timeout expires.
- SSH uses the OpenSSH default known-host verification behavior and never passes
  `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`.
- PostgreSQL backup/restore receives the complete connection configuration and routes
  external commands through the configured SSH tunnel.
- SSH tunnel startup confirms the local forward is listening and fails if the SSH
  process exits before readiness.
- PostgreSQL and SQLite unit/integration coverage is updated independently where the
  behavior differs.
